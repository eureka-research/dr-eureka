# HandFriction determines how much grip the hand has on objects. Given real-world materials can vary,
# we should include a range, but it shouldn't be too broad to maintain gripping capability while ensuring learning feasibility.
randomizeHandFrictionLower: 0.5
randomizeHandFrictionUpper: 5.0

# HandRestitution reflects the bounce when the hand hits something, which is less critical for this specific task of rotating a cube,
# yet minor variations could simulate real-world scenarios where the hand might interact with the cube with varying intensities.
randomizeHandRestitutionLower: 0.0
randomizeHandRestitutionUpper: 0.2

# HandDOFStiffness affects how forcefully the joints can move, which is crucial for controlling the cube rotation.
# A moderate range should allow the policy to adapt to different stiffness levels found in real hardware.
randomizeHandDOFStiffnessLower: 4.0
randomizeHandDOFStiffnessUpper: 8.0

# HandDOFDamping influences how movements are smoothed or resisted by the joints, affecting the control precision.
# Including a range here helps ensure that the policy can deal with varying damping in real hands.
randomizeHandDOFDampingLower: 0.1

# HandDOFFriction affects the internal joint movements. Since real robotic hands might have varying joint frictions,

# HandDOFArmature refers to the inertia of the hand joints, which could slightly vary in reality but typically remains low.
# We'll randomize it minimally as it's less critical for cube rotation but still worth considering for physical accuracy.

# ObjectMass is directly measured, but slight variations in mass distribution or accuracy of the measurement can occur.
# Thus, randomizing around the measured value simulates handling cubes of slightly different masses.

# ObjectCOM (Center of Mass) might shift slightly in real objects depending on manufacturing variances.
# Small randomization here can help the policy cope with such variances in balancing the cube during rotation.

# ObjectFriction affects how easily the cube rotates within the grasp. Since surface materials can vary greatly,
# a broader range here assists in preparing the policy for different cube surfaces.

# ObjectRestitution represents how bouncy the cube is when dropped or thrown, which is less relevant for rotations,
